============
Installation
============

Adlibre DMS can be easily installed on any operating system provided that a recent copy of a Python 2.6 interpreter is
available as well as any dependent system libraries.

Linux Requirements
------------------

Installation under Linux is the most straight forward.

The following system libraries are required:

* Python 2.6
* libtiff,
* poppler,
* a2ps,
* ghostscript


Supported Linux Distributions:

* Debian
* Ubuntu
* CentOS 5 / Red Hat 5

TODO: Write more specific deployment documentation.

OS X Requirements
-----------------

On OS X need the following will need to be installed using a 3rd party port / package manager:

For 'magic' based file type validation we require the following:

# port install perl5
# port install p5-file-libmagic

and the following for converter.py to function (libtiff, poppler, a2ps, ghostscript)

# port install tiff
# port install poppler
# port install a2ps
# port install ghostscript

NB. On OS X there is a bug with building ctypes. You will need to implement
this workaround https://trac.macports.org/ticket/22418
and if you get this error: 
>     env: /users/andrew/django/virtualenvs/dmsmerge/build/ctypes/source/libffi/configure: Permission denied
You'll need to make sure that _build/ctypes/source/libffi/configure_ is executable. (chmod +x if necessary).

Windows
-------

For commercial Windows installation support. Please enquire at http://www.adlibre.com.au/

Deployment
----------

We recommend deployment with _virtualenv_:

You will need to specify Python version if more than one installed eg. --python /usr/bin/python2.6

# mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages dms
# workon dms
# cdvirtualenv
# svn co https://svn.adlibre.net/projects/fasttrack/HEAD/ ./
# pip install -r deployment/pip-req.txt
